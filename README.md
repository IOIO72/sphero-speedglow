orbBasic script for Sphero 2 with light effect according to spheros speed

# What it does

Your Sphero changes the color from red (slow) to green (fast) according to its current speed.
If he hits an object, your Sphero flashes up and will have a short blackout.
If your Sphero flies while rolling relatively fast, he will turn to happy light white.
Additionally to all moves, the Sphero indicates its back like a tail by the blue dot light, which glows corresponding to the current speed.
